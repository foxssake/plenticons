# Tiny Tags

Tiny Tags is a pack of icons to use with custom nodes in the [Godot] editor.

Often, when working on projects, it would be nice to have some custom icons for
specific nodes, but finishing the project is a big enough task in itself.
Making custom icons for different nodes is often overkill, as it adds effort,
but doesn't effect the finished game at all.

This is where Tiny Tags comes in. It contains many icons, in multiple
variations, ready to use!
