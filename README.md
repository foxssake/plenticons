# plenticons

plenticons is a pack of icons to use with custom nodes in the [Godot] editor.

Often, when working on projects, it would be nice to have some custom icons for
specific nodes, but finishing the project is a big enough task in itself.
Making custom icons for different nodes is often overkill, as it adds effort,
but doesn't effect the finished game at all.

## Variations

Each icon comes in multiple color variations:

* Gray ( `#e0e0e0` )
* Red ( `#fc7f7f` )
* Blue ( `#8da5f3` )
* Green ( `#8eef97` )
* Yellow ( `#ffca5f` )

Variations are generated by a script, and then optimized by [svgo], before
packing.
