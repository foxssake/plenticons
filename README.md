## Overview

Often, when working on projects, it would be nice to have some custom icons for
specific nodes, but finishing the project is a big enough task in itself.
Making custom icons for different nodes is often overkill, as it adds effort,
but doesn't effect the finished game at all.

This is where *plenticons* saves the day! Providing many different icons,
instead of having to make them on your own, just pick and choose which one fits
your node!

Each icon comes in multiple color variations, using Godot's standard node
colors for your color coding pleasure! White and black variants are also
included, to be used as masks, or tinting.

And with its permissive license, *plenticons* can be used outside of the Godot
editor, in your games, applications, wherever you deem fit!
